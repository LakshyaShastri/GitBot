# GitBot

## What

It's a Discord bot that provides a basic interface to GitHub.

The name is crappy, I know, please create an Issue on this repo or DM me on
Discord (`@PyRet#4288`) to suggest a better name.

I'm not using any API wrapper since I want to reduce dependencies, and I want to
learn more about RESTful APIs.

Plus, having to wait for someone else to fix bugs or add support for new
endpoints is not something I want to do.

## Why

Idk why, I just thought it'd be cool to make a public Discord bot

## Contribution

PRs are always welcome. I'm new to async python, and discord.py, so my code
could prolly use some improving or suggestions
