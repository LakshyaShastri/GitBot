# GitBot

## What

It's a Discord bot that provides a basic interface to GitHub.

**Add the bot to your server:**
> [Clickable Link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=760195103712608356&permissions=8&scope=bot)
>
> Copy pastable link:
>
> ```https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=760195103712608356&permissions=8&scope=bot```

The name is crappy, I know, please create an Issue on this repo or DM me on
Discord (`@PyRet#4288`) to suggest a better name.

I'm not using any API wrapper for GitHub since I want to reduce dependencies, and I want to
learn more about RESTful APIs.

Plus, having to wait for someone else to fix bugs or add support for new
endpoints is not something I want to do.

## Why

Idk why, I just thought it'd be cool to make a public Discord bot

## Contribution

PRs are always welcome. I'm new to async python, and discord.py, so my code
could prolly use some improving or suggestions

Yes, we use branch main btw ðŸ˜Ž
